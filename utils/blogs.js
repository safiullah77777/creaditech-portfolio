      "With ground-breaking development in technology, consumers expect websites and applications to load quickly and may not spend their energy on a platform that takes too long to load. As new JavaScript (JS) frameworks and libraries enter the market every year, the changing ecosystem demands substance and optimized performance.",
      "Next JS and React are widely popular and are used to increase efficiency and improve the user interface. React is a JavaScript library that is used by front-end developers to create interactive apps. React was created by Facebook in 2011, open-sourced by 2013, and although technically, is not a framework but is usually referred to as one.",
      "On the other hand, Next JS is a framework that is developed and built on React UI components. Next JS aims to reduce the plethora of data that may overwhelm a developer by providing a zero- configuration environment. It gives a focused approach to beginners compared to the extensive tools on other frameworks that may seem intimidating.",
      "Frameworks such as Next JS give guidelines for the structuring of files and writing code as it focuses on multiple aspects of development rather than one.",

        "React is a flexible, effectual and competent library that utilizes JavaScript which is inspired by XHP. UIs that need consistent changes in data on their web apps usually integrate React. Page sections on Instagram and Facebook for example remain the same and only refresh when the posts and content refresh. React comes in handy in such instances.",
        "An archaic approach is for the whole app or website to reload completely each time a visitor clicks on a section. It may irk the user as it is timewasting and inefficient. React curbs this process as it uses components that are self-sufficient, sequestered and reusable. The components are then used to compose intricate and user-friendly UIs.",
        "Components guide React on what to display on the screen. If there are any changes, it is rendered. Rendering is a process where a new text or image is created when there are any updates or data alterations in the library.",
