As new JavaScript (JS) frameworks and libraries enter the market every year, the changing ecosystem demands substance and optimized performance.",
      "Next JS and React are widely popular and are used to increase efficiency and improve the user interface. React is a JavaScript library that is used by front-end developers to create interactive apps. React was created by Facebook in 2011, open-sourced by 2013, and although technically, is not a framework but is usually referred to as one.",
